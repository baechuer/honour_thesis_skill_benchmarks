# Skill Benchmark

This folder contains the working benchmark materials for my honours thesis on skill representation and retrieval for personal LLM agents.

The benchmark is grounded in recurring personal workflows rather than a random collection of tasks. The current skill families were chosen because they reflect realistic day-to-day knowledge work, including reading, writing, replying to messages, planning, handling documents, analysing spreadsheets, and interpreting operational metrics. These are the kinds of tasks that a personal agent could reasonably accumulate over time through custom skills or prebuilt skill libraries.

The central research problem is not simply whether skills are useful. It is whether an agent can select the correct skill when several skills look similar at the description level but differ procedurally in their inputs, outputs, workflow steps, preconditions, or success criteria.

This benchmark is therefore being developed in two layers:

1. A confusable core of carefully authored skills and test cases, where the procedural difference is clear and the gold skill can be annotated reliably.
2. A larger background library of additional skills used to create retrieval pressure, context growth, and more realistic selection conditions.

Public skill libraries are used as realism seeds for naming conventions, metadata style, and workflow patterns. However, the final benchmark skills are being authored and normalized here so that the resulting clusters have controlled semantic confusability and stable gold labels.

## Current folder structure

- `skills/`
  - one folder per benchmark skill
  - each skill can later contain `SKILL.md`, metadata, examples, or supporting files
- `clusters/`
  - cluster definitions describing which skills are confusable and why
- `prompts/`
  - benchmark prompts, candidate skills, and gold labels
- `notes/`
  - design notes, rationale, and benchmark decisions
- `scripts/`
  - small local utilities for reproducible benchmark checks
  - exporters for test workspaces with nanobot-compatible layouts

## Current candidate skill families

- reading / research
- news / monitoring
- reply / messaging
- email / communication
- planning / meetings
- documents / files
- data / spreadsheet
- metrics / observability

These categories may be refined as the benchmark becomes more grounded in my own actual workflows and as confusable cases are tested against candidate skill descriptions.

## Reproducible Checks

The benchmark includes a small scripted harness for early metadata-only confusability checks.

- Prompt set:
  - `prompts/reply_messaging_confusability.json`
- Runner:
  - `scripts/run_confusability_check.py`
- Flat workspace exporter:
  - `scripts/export_flat_workspace.py`
- Results cleaner:
  - `scripts/clean_confusability_results.py`
- Raw local outputs:
  - `runtime/confusability_results/`
- Manual annotation sheet:
  - `notes/reply_messaging_confusability_sheet.md`

For nanobot testing, keep the source benchmark grouped by family under `skills/`,
but export a flat workspace under `runtime/` because nanobot expects
`/workspace/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` rather than nested family folders.

## Reproduction Dependency: nanobot

These benchmark runs depend on a local Docker image of a modified nanobot build rather than an untouched upstream release.

- Base repository:
  - [baechuer/nanobot](https://github.com/baechuer/nanobot.git)
- Local benchmark dependency:
  - a modified local checkout of that repository
- Important modification:
  - nanobot was patched so skill reads log explicit hint lines in the form `↳ skill <skill-name>`
  - this is necessary because the benchmark harness infers selected skills from nanobot trace output
  - without this change, many runs collapse into fake bypass rows because abbreviated traces do not preserve the exact selected skill name

In practice, this means the benchmark should be run against the modified local nanobot image used during development of this benchmark, not a stock image pulled from elsewhere.

Typical workflow:

```bash
cd "/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour Thesis/nanobot"
docker build -t nanobot .
```

Then run the benchmark scripts from:

```bash
cd "/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour Thesis/skill_benchmark"
```

If the nanobot logging behavior changes, the benchmark manifest may need to be repaired by rerunning:

```bash
python3 scripts/rebuild_manifest_selected_skills.py
```

This project therefore assumes:

- a local Docker image named `nanobot`
- built from the modified forked checkout rather than an arbitrary upstream version
- benchmark runs executed only after that image has been rebuilt

## Recorded Group: Reply / Messaging

This is the first reply-focused cluster that has been tested with cold-session nanobot runs.

### Current skills in this group

- `reply-drafter`
- `reply-polisher`
- `professor-email-reply`
- `groupwork-reply`
- `followup-reply-writer`

### Basic prompt set

| Prompt ID | Prompt purpose | Gold skill | Acceptable but not ideal alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reply_p1_professor_reply` | Draft a reply to a professor about meeting availability | `professor-email-reply` | `reply-drafter`, `reply-polisher` |
| `reply_p2_polish_supervisor` | Refine an existing draft for a supervisor while preserving meaning and commitments | `reply-polisher` | `professor-email-reply`, `reply-drafter` |
| `reply_p3_groupwork_coordination` | Reply to a group coordination message about ownership and deadlines | `groupwork-reply` | `reply-drafter`, `followup-reply-writer` |
| `reply_p4_followup_commitment` | Reply with next actions and timing commitments | `followup-reply-writer` | `reply-drafter`, `groupwork-reply` |
| `reply_p5_generic_fresh_draft` | Draft a concise fresh reply confirming a revision will be sent tomorrow | `reply-drafter` | `reply-polisher`, `followup-reply-writer` |

Full prompt definitions currently live in:

- `prompts/reply_messaging_confusability.json`

### Current results

These results come from 5 cold-session runs per prompt using the nanobot harness with unique session IDs for each run.

| Prompt ID | Gold skill | Top-1 correct | Main observed confusion | Interpretation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `reply_p1_professor_reply` | `professor-email-reply` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and likely too easy in its current form |
| `reply_p2_polish_supervisor` | `reply-polisher` | `0/5` | Always selected `professor-email-reply` | Strong failure case; recipient cue appears to overpower the draft-polishing cue |
| `reply_p3_groupwork_coordination` | `groupwork-reply` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and likely too easy in its current form |
| `reply_p4_followup_commitment` | `followup-reply-writer` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and likely too easy in its current form |
| `reply_p5_generic_fresh_draft` | `reply-drafter` | `4/5` | Confused once with `followup-reply-writer` | Mild but useful confusable case |

Current aggregate metrics for this group:

- `25` total runs
- `19/25` top-1 correct (`76.0%`)
- `0/25` bypassed skill selection (`0.0%`)
- `6/25` wrong-skill selections (`24.0%`)

### Current reading of this group

- The cluster is not uniformly hard. Three prompts are currently very stable and may be too easy.
- `reply_p2_polish_supervisor` is the strongest evidence of a real selection problem in this group.
- `reply_p5_generic_fresh_draft` is a smaller but useful confusable case because `reply-drafter` and `followup-reply-writer` can both look plausible.
- A good downstream output does not count as retrieval success if the gold skill was not selected. This matters especially for `reply_p2_polish_supervisor`, where the model often produces a reasonable formal reply while still choosing the wrong skill.

## Recorded Group: Planning / Meetings

This is the second cluster that has been tested with cold-session nanobot runs. The first draft of these prompts was too easy, so the recorded results below use a more confusable second-pass prompt set with mixed cues.

### Current skills in this group

- `meeting-agenda-builder`
- `meeting-summary-writer`
- `meeting-followup-extractor`
- `task-extractor`
- `weekly-planner`

### Basic prompt set

| Prompt ID | Prompt purpose | Gold skill | Acceptable but not ideal alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plan_p1_meeting_agenda` | Turn a short project-meeting situation into something structured that can be used during the meeting | `meeting-agenda-builder` | `weekly-planner`, `task-extractor` |
| `plan_p2_meeting_summary` | Turn meeting notes into something clean that shows what came out of the discussion and what still needs attention | `meeting-summary-writer` | `meeting-followup-extractor`, `task-extractor` |
| `plan_p3_meeting_followup` | Turn meeting notes into something clean that shows what needs to happen next and what still needs attention | `meeting-followup-extractor` | `meeting-summary-writer`, `task-extractor` |
| `plan_p4_task_extractor` | Turn mixed week-related notes into something usable by identifying what actually needs to be done | `task-extractor` | `weekly-planner`, `meeting-followup-extractor` |
| `plan_p5_weekly_planner` | Turn a week of obligations, classes, and meeting preparation into something manageable | `weekly-planner` | `task-extractor`, `meeting-agenda-builder` |

Full prompt definitions currently live in:

- `prompts/planning_meetings_confusability.json`

### Current results

These results come from 5 cold-session runs per prompt using the nanobot harness with unique session IDs for each run.

| Prompt ID | Gold skill | Top-1 correct | Main observed confusion | Interpretation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `plan_p1_meeting_agenda` | `meeting-agenda-builder` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and likely still easy |
| `plan_p2_meeting_summary` | `meeting-summary-writer` | `3/5` | Confused with `meeting-followup-extractor` | Good confusable case and strong summary/follow-up pair |
| `plan_p3_meeting_followup` | `meeting-followup-extractor` | `5/5` | Also read `task-extractor` in several runs | Stable gold, but shows neighboring procedural overlap |
| `plan_p4_task_extractor` | `task-extractor` | `2/5` | Confused with `weekly-planner` | Strong and useful confusion case |
| `plan_p5_weekly_planner` | `weekly-planner` | `4/5` | One bypassed run | Mildly confusable and mostly stable |

Current aggregate metrics for this group:

- `25` total runs
- `19/25` top-1 correct (`76.0%`)
- `20/25` any-hit correct (`80.0%`)
- `1/25` bypassed skill selection (`4.0%`)
- `5/25` wrong-skill selections (`20.0%`)

### Current reading of this group

- This second-pass prompt set is much better than the first planning batch.
- `plan_p2_meeting_summary` and `plan_p3_meeting_followup` now form a useful minimal pair for summary vs action-oriented post-meeting handling.
- `plan_p4_task_extractor` is a strong confusion case because mixed week-planning language can pull the model toward `weekly-planner`.
- `plan_p1_meeting_agenda` still looks too easy in its current form.
- The planning/meeting family is now a meaningful confusable cluster, but not uniformly hard.

## Recorded Group: News / Monitoring

This family has now been implemented and tested with cold-session nanobot runs. At the moment it behaves more like a background or neighboring family than a strong confusion-heavy core cluster.

### Current skills in this group

- `news-summariser`
- `news-theme-extractor`
- `source-grounding-extractor`
- `news-briefing-writer`
- `tech-news-trend-extractor`

### Basic prompt set

| Prompt ID | Prompt purpose | Gold skill | Acceptable but not ideal alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `news_p1_plain_summary` | Summarise a rich single-source tech article in a straightforward way | `news-summariser` | `news-briefing-writer`, `source-grounding-extractor` |
| `news_p2_briefing` | Turn the same rich single-source tech article into a short briefing with significance and watch-points | `news-briefing-writer` | `news-summariser`, `tech-news-trend-extractor` |
| `news_p3_grounded_claims` | Extract directly grounded claims and facts from the source article | `source-grounding-extractor` | `news-summariser`, `news-briefing-writer` |
| `news_p4_theme_extraction` | Pull out recurring themes across multiple tech news snippets | `news-theme-extractor` | `tech-news-trend-extractor`, `news-briefing-writer` |
| `news_p5_trend_signal` | Judge which trends seem to be gaining momentum across the same multi-item bundle | `tech-news-trend-extractor` | `news-theme-extractor`, `news-briefing-writer` |

Full prompt definitions currently live in:

- `prompts/news_monitoring_confusability.json`

### Current results

These results come from 5 cold-session runs per prompt using the nanobot harness with unique session IDs for each run.

| Prompt ID | Gold skill | Top-1 correct | Main observed confusion | Interpretation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `news_p1_plain_summary` | `news-summariser` | `2/5` | Mostly bypassed skill selection | Weak retrieval-sensitive case; the model often answers directly |
| `news_p2_briefing` | `news-briefing-writer` | `4/5` | One bypassed run | Mildly confusable with summary, but still mostly easy |
| `news_p3_grounded_claims` | `source-grounding-extractor` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and very distinct |
| `news_p4_theme_extraction` | `news-theme-extractor` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and likely too easy |
| `news_p5_trend_signal` | `tech-news-trend-extractor` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and likely too easy |

Current aggregate metrics for this group:

- `25` total runs
- `21/25` top-1 correct (`84.0%`)
- `21/25` any-hit correct (`84.0%`)
- `4/25` bypassed skill selection (`16.0%`)
- `0/25` wrong-skill selections (`0.0%`)

### Current reading of this group

- This family is not yet a strong confusable core cluster.
- The main weakness is bypass, especially for `news_p1_plain_summary`, where the model often answers directly instead of selecting the summary skill.
- `news-summariser` and `news-briefing-writer` are the closest pair in the family, but the current prompts still do not create much wrong-skill confusion.
- `source-grounding-extractor`, `news-theme-extractor`, and `tech-news-trend-extractor` are currently too distinct and easy.
- At this stage, `news_monitoring` works better as a realistic neighboring or background family than as one of the strongest benchmark stress-test clusters.

## Recorded Group: Reading / Research

This family has now been implemented and tested with cold-session nanobot runs. The current results are useful because they show three different regimes in one family: easy separation, real overlap, and output-shape collapse.

### Current skills in this group

- `paper-summariser`
- `general-source-summariser`
- `document-extractor`
- `citation-note-extractor`
- `citation-grounding-helper`
- `method-note-builder`
- `multi-source-comparison-builder`
- `related-work-synthesiser`

### Basic prompt set

| Prompt ID | Prompt purpose | Gold skill | Acceptable but not ideal alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read_p1_paper_summary` | Summarise a research-structured source into what it is doing, how it works, what it finds, and what to be careful about | `paper-summariser` | `general-source-summariser`, `method-note-builder`, `citation-note-extractor` |
| `read_p2_general_source_summary` | Summarise a more report-like source with the same high-level ask as `read_p1` | `general-source-summariser` | `paper-summariser`, `document-extractor`, `citation-note-extractor` |
| `read_p3_citation_notes` | Turn a source into reusable writing-oriented notes with support and caution | `citation-note-extractor` | `document-extractor`, `paper-summariser`, `citation-grounding-helper` |
| `read_p4_document_extraction` | Pull out specific details, claims, evidence, and limitations to keep from a source | `document-extractor` | `citation-note-extractor`, `method-note-builder`, `paper-summariser` |
| `read_p5_method_notes` | Focus on how the work was carried out, evaluated, and constrained | `method-note-builder` | `paper-summariser`, `document-extractor`, `citation-note-extractor` |
| `read_p6_grounding_check` | Check whether a drafted sentence is actually supported by the source and tighten it | `citation-grounding-helper` | `citation-note-extractor`, `paper-summariser`, `document-extractor` |
| `read_p7_multi_source_comparison` | Make sense of two sources by showing how they line up and differ | `multi-source-comparison-builder` | `related-work-synthesiser`, `method-note-builder`, `citation-note-extractor` |
| `read_p8_related_work_synthesis` | Make sense of two sources by explaining the approaches, relationship, and what remains unresolved | `related-work-synthesiser` | `multi-source-comparison-builder`, `citation-note-extractor`, `paper-summariser` |

Full prompt definitions currently live in:

- `prompts/reading_research_confusability.json`

### Current results

These results come from 5 cold-session runs per prompt using the nanobot harness with unique session IDs for each run.

| Prompt ID | Gold skill | Top-1 correct | Main observed confusion | Interpretation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `read_p1_paper_summary` | `paper-summariser` | `1/5` | Mostly recorded as bypass, but outputs often still look like paper-style summaries | Good output quality can still occur without an observable skill trace; currently weak as a retrieval-sensitive case |
| `read_p2_general_source_summary` | `general-source-summariser` | `4/5` | One run selected `paper-summariser`, one run consulted both | Mildly confusable and a good near-neighbor pair with `paper-summariser` |
| `read_p3_citation_notes` | `citation-note-extractor` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and currently easy |
| `read_p4_document_extraction` | `document-extractor` | `0/5` | Repeatedly selected `citation-note-extractor` | Strong confusion case; extraction collapses into writing-oriented citation notes |
| `read_p5_method_notes` | `method-note-builder` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and currently easy |
| `read_p6_grounding_check` | `citation-grounding-helper` | `2/5` | Three runs recorded as bypass | Behaviorally useful, but some failures look like run artifacts rather than clean semantic misses |
| `read_p7_multi_source_comparison` | `multi-source-comparison-builder` | `0/5` in manifest | Manifest records bypass, but outputs are clearly structured comparisons | Likely parser-blind in these runs rather than true no-skill behavior |
| `read_p8_related_work_synthesis` | `related-work-synthesiser` | `0/5` in manifest | Outputs repeatedly collapse into comparison-style artifacts | Strong output-shape failure: the synthesis prompt still tends to pull the model into comparison mode |

Current aggregate metrics for this group:

- `40` total runs
- `17/40` top-1 correct (`42.5%`)
- `17/40` any-hit correct (`42.5%`)
- `18/40` bypassed skill selection (`45.0%`)
- `5/40` wrong-skill selections (`12.5%`)
- `1/40` multi-skill consultation (`2.5%`)

### Current reading of this group

- This family is not uniformly confusable. Some skills are very stable, while others expose useful overlap or artifact-shape collapse.
- `document-extractor` vs `citation-note-extractor` is the clearest genuine confusion pair in the current batch. The model repeatedly chose `citation-note-extractor` for `read_p4_document_extraction`.
- That repeated wrong selection still produced usable output. The answers were often satisfactory for a human reader, but they were still weaker than the gold because they favored citation-style notes over more explicit extraction structure.
- `read_p2_general_source_summary` shows a milder and more realistic near-neighbor case: one run selected `paper-summariser`, and another consulted both `general-source-summariser` and `paper-summariser`. The wrong-skill output was still acceptable, but the gold skill provides a better fit because it avoids unnecessary paper-style framing.
- `read_p7_multi_source_comparison` appears stronger behaviorally than the manifest suggests. The parser recorded bypasses, but the actual outputs are clear comparison artifacts, so these runs should not be interpreted as true non-use of skills.
- `read_p8_related_work_synthesis` is the most important failure case in this family. Even when the answer is useful, it often takes the form of a side-by-side comparison rather than a related-work style synthesis, which matters because the artifact shape is part of the gold skill definition.
- For this family, downstream usefulness and retrieval success come apart in an important way. Several wrong or unobserved selections still produced satisfactory answers, but the gold skill generally remains more competitive because it gives the more appropriate output structure for the task.
- Any explanation of why this happens should be treated as interpretive rather than causal. Since the underlying model is effectively a black box, the safest claims here are about observable behavior: selection patterns, output shapes, and recurring failure modes.

## Recorded Group: Metrics / Observability

This family has now been implemented and tested with cold-session nanobot runs. The first version of the observability prompts was too easy, so the results below use a softer second-pass prompt set that relies more on overlapping operational framing and less on explicit task labels.

### Current skills in this group

- `metrics-overview`
- `latency-anomaly-detector`
- `slo-breach-checker`
- `capacity-risk-forecaster`
- `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser`
- `incident-summary-writer`

### Basic prompt set

| Prompt ID | Prompt purpose | Gold skill | Acceptable but not ideal alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `obs_p1_metrics_overview` | Make sense of the service snapshot and identify what matters most right now | `metrics-overview` | `incident-summary-writer`, `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser`, `latency-anomaly-detector` |
| `obs_p2_latency_anomaly` | Make sense of the performance behavior and whether the issue looks broad or concentrated | `latency-anomaly-detector` | `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser`, `metrics-overview`, `slo-breach-checker` |
| `obs_p3_slo_breach` | Make sense of the snapshot from a reliability-target point of view and whether the service objective is in danger | `slo-breach-checker` | `capacity-risk-forecaster`, `metrics-overview`, `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser` |
| `obs_p4_capacity_risk` | Make sense of whether the current pattern could escalate into a bigger operational problem if it continues | `capacity-risk-forecaster` | `slo-breach-checker`, `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser`, `metrics-overview` |
| `obs_p5_root_cause` | Make sense of what is most likely driving the degradation and what evidence points that way | `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser` | `latency-anomaly-detector`, `capacity-risk-forecaster`, `incident-summary-writer` |
| `obs_p6_incident_summary` | Turn the same snapshot into something quickly shareable with the team about impact, status, and open attention points | `incident-summary-writer` | `metrics-overview`, `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser`, `slo-breach-checker` |

Full prompt definitions currently live in:

- `prompts/metrics_observability_confusability.json`

### Current results

These results come from 5 cold-session runs per prompt using the nanobot harness with unique session IDs for each run.

| Prompt ID | Gold skill | Top-1 correct | Main observed confusion | Interpretation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `obs_p1_metrics_overview` | `metrics-overview` | `5/5` | Also consulted `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser` in some runs | Strong and stable, but now shows real neighboring overlap |
| `obs_p2_latency_anomaly` | `latency-anomaly-detector` | `2/5` | Frequently selected `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser` | Strong confusion case; anomaly-focused prompts are often pulled into diagnosis |
| `obs_p3_slo_breach` | `slo-breach-checker` | `3/5` | Often co-selected `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser` | Good confusable case for reliability judgment vs diagnosis |
| `obs_p4_capacity_risk` | `capacity-risk-forecaster` | `3/5` | Sometimes selected `metrics-overview` first | Good confusable case for forward-looking risk vs broad health readout |
| `obs_p5_root_cause` | `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Strongest and most stable skill in the family |
| `obs_p6_incident_summary` | `incident-summary-writer` | `4/5` | One run recorded as bypass | Behaviorally strong; the one recorded miss was a provider failure rather than a meaningful semantic bypass |

Current aggregate metrics for this group:

- `30` total runs
- `22/30` top-1 correct (`73.3%`)
- `26/30` any-hit correct (`86.7%`)
- `2/30` bypassed skill selection (`6.7%`)
- `6/30` wrong-skill selections (`20.0%`)
- `12/30` multi-skill consultation (`40.0%`)

### Current reading of this group

- The softer second-pass prompt set worked. This family is now a genuinely confusable cluster rather than a near-trivial separation task.
- The strongest signal is not only wrong top-1 selection, but also the high `40.0%` multi-skill consultation rate. The model now regularly explores neighboring observability skills before settling.
- `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser` acts as the strongest attractor in the family. It frequently pulls in `obs_p2_latency_anomaly` and `obs_p3_slo_breach`, suggesting that once prompts become less label-shaped, diagnosis becomes a default neighboring frame.
- `obs_p2_latency_anomaly` is the clearest example of wrong skill but still satisfactory output. Several runs selected `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser`, yet the answers still correctly described a concentrated tail-latency problem. The gold skill remains better because it keeps the output centered on anomaly shape rather than causal explanation.
- `obs_p4_capacity_risk` shows a similar pattern. Some runs drifted toward `metrics-overview`, but the resulting answers were still often usable. The gold skill still provides the stronger artifact because it keeps the framing explicitly forward-looking and risk-oriented.
- `obs_p5_root_cause` is the most stable skill in the family. It consistently produces the intended diagnostic artifact and does not appear especially vulnerable to confusion from neighboring skills.
- `obs_p6_incident_summary` is stronger than the raw bypass count suggests. The one `none` row in the manifest was caused by a `503` model-availability failure, not a meaningful retrieval or semantic miss.
- This family is a good example of retrieval success and answer usefulness coming apart. Several wrong-skill selections still produced acceptable outputs, but the gold skill remains more competitive because it yields the cleaner intended artifact more consistently.
- As with the other groups, any explanation of why this happens should be treated as behavioral interpretation rather than causal account. The underlying model remains a black box, so the strongest claims are about observed selection patterns, artifact shapes, and recurring confusion neighbors.

## Recorded Group: Documents / Files

This family has now been implemented and tested with cold-session nanobot runs. The first document batch was partially distorted by prompt shape, so the recorded results below use a file-based fixture setup where prompts reference concrete documents inside the benchmark workspace.

### Current skills in this group

- `document-summariser`
- `document-rewriter`
- `document-field-extractor`
- `document-normaliser`
- `document-converter`
- `layout-preserving-converter`
- `multi-document-comparison-preparer`

### Basic prompt set

| Prompt ID | Prompt purpose | Gold skill | Acceptable but not ideal alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `doc_p1_document_summary` | Read a practical policy file and summarise its purpose, main details, and important conditions | `document-summariser` | `document-normaliser`, `document-field-extractor`, `document-converter` |
| `doc_p2_document_rewriter` | Rewrite a rough travel-policy note to make it clearer without changing its meaning | `document-rewriter` | `document-normaliser`, `document-summariser`, `document-converter` |

### Current results

These results come from 5 cold-session runs per prompt using the nanobot harness with unique session IDs for each run.

| Prompt ID | Gold skill | Top-1 correct | Main observed confusion | Interpretation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `doc_p1_document_summary` | `document-summariser` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | The file-based fixture setup fixed the earlier broken prompt and made this case stable |
| `doc_p2_document_rewriter` | `document-rewriter` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and currently easy |
| `doc_p3_document_normaliser` | `document-normaliser` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and currently easy |
| `doc_p4_field_extraction` | `document-field-extractor` | `1/5` in manifest | Most runs recorded as bypass, but outputs still looked like usable extraction artifacts | Likely weak retrieval pressure or parser blind spots rather than harmful failure |
| `doc_p5_comparison_preparation` | `multi-document-comparison-preparer` | `0/5` in manifest | Manifest records bypass, but outputs are clearly structured comparisons | Strong parser-blind case rather than true semantic non-use |
| `doc_p6_conversion` | `document-converter` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and currently easy |
| `doc_p7_layout_preserving_conversion` | `layout-preserving-converter` | `0/5` | Always selected `document-converter` | Strong and useful confusion case; layout-preserving conversion currently collapses into generic conversion |

Current aggregate metrics for this group:

- `35` total runs
- `21/35` top-1 correct (`60.0%`)
- `21/35` any-hit correct (`60.0%`)
- `9/35` bypassed skill selection (`25.7%`)
- `5/35` wrong-skill selections (`14.3%`)
- `0/35` multi-skill consultation (`0.0%`)

### Current reading of this group

- The file-based fixtures were the right change. They removed the earlier false failure mode where the model interpreted `doc_p1` as a missing attachment.
- This family is still not a uniformly hard confusable cluster. `document-summariser`, `document-rewriter`, `document-normaliser`, and `document-converter` are all currently very stable.
- `doc_p4_field_extraction` is weaker as a retrieval-sensitive case than the raw manifest suggests. Several runs showed no observed skill selection, but the outputs still extracted the right invoice details in a usable format. The gold skill remains preferable because it should make this behavior more reliably explicit and structured.
- `doc_p5_comparison_preparation` appears stronger behaviorally than the manifest reports. The trace frequently shows abbreviated `read …/SKILL.md` lines plus reads of both policy draft files, and the outputs are clear comparison artifacts. This looks like a parser limitation rather than true bypass.
- `doc_p7_layout_preserving_conversion` is the most meaningful failure in the family. All five runs selected `document-converter`, and the outputs were still quite good, but they did not establish a reliably distinct artifact for `layout-preserving-converter`.
- This makes `document-converter` vs `layout-preserving-converter` the clearest genuine overlap pair in the group. The wrong skill often still produces satisfactory output, which is precisely why the distinction is benchmark-relevant.
- Overall, this family currently shows one real confusion pair, one parser-blind comparison case, and several easy/stable items. It is useful, but not yet one of the strongest stress-test clusters in the benchmark.

## Recorded Group: Data / Spreadsheet

This family has now been implemented and tested with cold-session nanobot runs. The first spreadsheet versions were too directly answerable from a small clean CSV, so the current version uses a messier sheet plus helper scripts to make retrieval more meaningful. The latest prompt set is also intentionally softer and more overlapping, so several asks sit between overview, anomaly, validation, root-cause, reporting, forecasting, and ranking.

### Current skills in this group

- `data-analysis-overview`
- `data-analysis-for-reporting`
- `data-analysis-for-forecasting`
- `data-analysis-for-ranking-selection`
- `data-analysis-for-root-cause-diagnosis`
- `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus`
- `data-analysis-with-validation`

### Basic prompt set

| Prompt ID | Prompt purpose | Gold skill | Acceptable but not ideal alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data_p1_overview` | Get oriented on a weekly channel-performance sheet and say something useful to the team | `data-analysis-overview` | `data-analysis-for-reporting`, `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus`, `data-analysis-with-validation` |
| `data_p2_anomaly_focus` | Identify what looks most worth worrying about and how confident we should be that it is real | `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus` | `data-analysis-overview`, `data-analysis-for-root-cause-diagnosis`, `data-analysis-with-validation` |
| `data_p3_validation` | Separate genuine problems from things in the sheet that should not be trusted yet | `data-analysis-with-validation` | `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus`, `data-analysis-overview`, `data-analysis-for-root-cause-diagnosis` |
| `data_p4_root_cause` | Work out whether worsening performance is genuine and what is most likely driving it | `data-analysis-for-root-cause-diagnosis` | `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus`, `data-analysis-overview`, `data-analysis-with-validation` |
| `data_p5_reporting` | Turn the sheet into something useful to send upward without dragging someone through the data | `data-analysis-for-reporting` | `data-analysis-overview`, `data-analysis-for-root-cause-diagnosis`, `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus` |
| `data_p6_forecasting` | Judge what likely happens next if the current pattern continues | `data-analysis-for-forecasting` | `data-analysis-overview`, `data-analysis-for-root-cause-diagnosis`, `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus` |
| `data_p7_ranking_selection` | Decide where to lean first from a pilot-priority options table and what to expect next | `data-analysis-for-ranking-selection` | `data-analysis-for-forecasting`, `data-analysis-overview`, `data-analysis-for-reporting` |

### Current results

These results come from 5 cold-session runs per prompt using the nanobot harness with unique session IDs for each run.

| Prompt ID | Gold skill | Top-1 correct | Main observed confusion | Interpretation |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `data_p1_overview` | `data-analysis-overview` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Stable and clearly retrieval-sensitive in the current setup |
| `data_p2_anomaly_focus` | `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus` | `2/5` | Mostly bypass rather than wrong-neighbor selection | Good direct answers often appear without retrieval; the gold skill still gives the stronger anomaly artifact |
| `data_p3_validation` | `data-analysis-with-validation` | `2/5` | Mostly bypass, with answers drifting toward mixed validation/anomaly analysis | Retrieval matters for keeping the output validation-shaped |
| `data_p4_root_cause` | `data-analysis-for-root-cause-diagnosis` | `0/5` in manifest | Genuine pulls toward `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus` and `data-analysis-overview`, plus parser contamination from echoed skill names in trace prose | Most meaningful confusable case in the family, but current manifest overstates its noise |
| `data_p5_reporting` | `data-analysis-for-reporting` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Strong and stable |
| `data_p6_forecasting` | `data-analysis-for-forecasting` | `5/5` | None observed in current batch | Strong and stable |
| `data_p7_ranking_selection` | `data-analysis-for-ranking-selection` | `1/5` | Mostly bypass rather than wrong-neighbor selection | Direct answers are often good, so this currently measures retrieval need more than confusion |

Current aggregate metrics for this group from the current CSV slice:

- `35` total runs
- `20/35` top-1 correct (`57.1%`)
- `20/35` any-hit correct (`57.1%`)
- `10/35` bypassed skill selection (`28.6%`)
- `5/35` wrong-skill selections (`14.3%`)
- `3/35` multi-skill consultation (`8.6%`)

### Current reading of this group

- The harder sheet and helper logic improved this family substantially. It is no longer just an “easy CSV read” family, and several prompts now do trigger the intended spreadsheet skills.
- This is still not a uniformly confusable cluster. Much of the pressure in the family is still split between gold-skill selection and direct-answer bypass rather than between two clearly competing neighbor skills.
- `data_p2_anomaly_focus` is a good example of this. Bypass runs often still produce useful answers, but the selected-skill runs are more structured and make better use of evidence and confidence framing.
- `data_p3_validation` behaves similarly. The bypass answers are often sensible, but they drift toward mixed anomaly-plus-diagnosis prose. The gold skill remains more competitive because it produces a cleaner validation artifact.
- `data_p4_root_cause` is the most important confusable case. Some runs truly lean toward `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus` or `data-analysis-overview`, which shows real semantic overlap. At the same time, the manifest is partially polluted because nanobot sometimes says things like “I’ll use the `data-analysis-with-anomaly-focus` skill” in free text, and the parser currently records those words as if they were clean hint events.
- `data_p5_reporting` and `data_p6_forecasting` are both strong and stable in the current setup.
- `data_p7_ranking_selection` is currently more of a retrieval-vs-bypass case than a true confusion case. Several non-skill runs still produce strong recommendations, so the benchmark signal here is more about whether the model feels it needs the skill than about which competing skill it chooses.
- Overall, this family is now useful, but it is still mixed in character. It contains some good retrieval-sensitive prompts, one real overlap case (`data_p4_root_cause`), and several tasks where direct answering remains strong enough to compete with retrieval.

## Recorded Condition: Full-Pool / All-Families Run

This condition evaluates the benchmark in a more complex setting where the flat workspace contains the full exported skill pool rather than a single family. The goal is to see whether isolated-family behavior still holds when unrelated but semantically nearby skills are available.

These results use the repaired harness logic:

- `selected_skills` are rebuilt from raw stdout/stderr using `scripts/rebuild_manifest_selected_skills.py`
- only valid exported skill names are counted
- junk tokens like `to`, `will`, or `directory` are excluded
- the prompt set comes from all `*_confusability.json` files together

### Overall full-pool metrics

These results come from 3 cold-session runs per prompt across the full prompt set.

- `129` total runs
- `88/129` top-1 correct (`68.2%`)
- `90/129` any-hit correct (`69.8%`)
- `28/129` bypassed skill selection (`21.7%`)
- `13/129` wrong-skill selections (`10.1%`)
- `5/129` multi-skill consultation (`3.9%`)

### Family comparison: isolated vs full-pool

| Family | Isolated top-1 | Full-pool top-1 | Isolated bypass | Full-pool bypass | Isolated wrong | Full-pool wrong | Reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `reply_messaging` | `76.0%` | `93.3%` | `0.0%` | `0.0%` | `24.0%` | `6.7%` | Became more stable under the full pool |
| `planning_meetings` | `76.0%` | `73.3%` | `4.0%` | `26.7%` | `20.0%` | `0.0%` | Neighbor confusion decreased, but direct-answer bypass increased |
| `news_monitoring` | `84.0%` | `86.7%` | `16.0%` | `6.7%` | `0.0%` | `6.7%` | Mostly held up; one clean cross-family miss to `general-source-summariser` |
| `reading_research` | `42.5%` | `75.0%` | `45.0%` | `0.0%` | `12.5%` | `25.0%` | Bypass was converted into real neighbor confusion |
| `metrics_observability` | `73.3%` | `77.8%` | `6.7%` | `0.0%` | `20.0%` | `22.2%` | Remains one of the strongest genuinely confusable clusters |
| `documents_files` | `60.0%` | `66.7%` | `25.7%` | `33.3%` | `14.3%` | `0.0%` | More bypass-heavy, less wrong-neighbor pressure |
| `data_spreadsheet` | `57.1%` | `19.0%` | `28.6%` | `76.2%` | `14.3%` | `4.8%` | Collapsed into direct-answer bypass rather than neighbor confusion |

### Full-pool reading

- The full-pool condition does not make every family “more confusable.” It creates a split between families that remain robust, families that become more neighbor-confusable, and families that mostly bypass retrieval and answer directly.
- `metrics_observability` and `reading_research` remain the strongest genuine confusable clusters in the full pool. They still show wrong-neighbor selection on semantically plausible alternatives rather than simply bypassing.
- `data_spreadsheet` is the clearest example of a family that weakens under the full pool. The model often skips retrieval entirely and answers directly from the CSV, so the condition becomes more about bypass than about skill confusion.
- `documents_files` shows a similar but milder pattern. Several bypassed runs still produce useful outputs, so retrieval weakness does not automatically imply poor downstream task performance.
- `reply_messaging` actually became more stable in the full pool. This suggests its skills remain distinctive enough even when many other families are available.

### Downstream performance under the full pool

This condition is important because retrieval success and answer usefulness do not always move together.

#### Bypassed runs that still produced useful outputs

- [data_p1_overview run1](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T021308Z__data_p1_overview__run1.stdout.txt): no skill selected, but still a useful overview of strong performers, concerns, and data gaps.
- [data_p7_ranking_selection run2](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T022139Z__data_p7_ranking_selection__run2.stdout.txt): no skill selected, but still a sensible recommendation with practical next steps.
- [doc_p4_field_extraction run1](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T022424Z__doc_p4_field_extraction__run1.stdout.txt): no skill selected, but still extracts the invoice fields cleanly.
- [plan_p5_weekly_planner run1](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T023838Z__plan_p5_weekly_planner__run1.stdout.txt): no skill selected, but still produces a workable weekly plan.

These runs justify treating some bypasses as useful downstream behavior rather than outright answer failure. In these cases, the model appears able to satisfy the task directly from the prompt and source material.

#### Wrong-skill runs that were still useful

- [news_p1_plain_summary run1](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T023211Z__news_p1_plain_summary__run1.stdout.txt): selected `general-source-summariser` instead of `news-summariser`, but still produced a solid summary.
- [read_p4_document_extraction run1](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T024140Z__read_p4_document_extraction__run1.stdout.txt): selected `citation-note-extractor` instead of `document-extractor`; the output is useful, but more note-shaped than extraction-shaped.
- [read_p8_related_work_synthesis run1](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T024458Z__read_p8_related_work_synthesis__run1.stdout.txt): selected `multi-source-comparison-builder`; the content is useful, but the final artifact is more comparison-like than true synthesis.

These cases matter because they show that wrong-skill selection can still produce acceptable content while missing the gold artifact shape.

#### Wrong-skill or selected-skill runs that were not downstream-successful

- [obs_p2_latency_anomaly run2](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T022756Z__obs_p2_latency_anomaly__run2.stdout.txt): selected `metrics-overview`, then ended in a subagent-handoff message instead of a finished answer.
- [obs_p3_slo_breach run3](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T022909Z__obs_p3_slo_breach__run3.stdout.txt): selected `metrics-root-cause-diagnoser`, then also ended in a subagent-handoff message.
- [obs_p5_root_cause run1](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T023027Z__obs_p5_root_cause__run1.stdout.txt): selected the correct gold skill, but still returned a subagent-handoff rather than a completed diagnosis.
- [reply_p4_followup_commitment run1](/Users/jackyzhang/Work/Honour%20Thesis/skill_benchmark/runtime/confusability_results/20260423T021152Z__reply_p4_followup_commitment__run1.stdout.txt): selected `reply-drafter` and asked for clarification instead of producing the intended follow-up commitment reply.

These are the most important harmful failures. They show that correct retrieval alone does not guarantee good downstream performance, and that some of the worst user-facing failures happen after a skill is selected.

### Interpreting bypass, wrong-skill, and multi-skill behavior

- **Bypass** should not automatically be read as downstream failure. In several families, especially `data_spreadsheet`, `documents_files`, and `planning_meetings`, many bypassed runs still answered the prompt usefully.
- **Wrong-skill selection** is more serious than bypass when it changes the artifact shape or prevents completion. The clearest examples are in `metrics_observability` and `reading_research`.
- **Multi-skill consultation** indicates that the task looked ambiguous enough for the model to inspect more than one nearby skill before answering. In the full-pool run, this is uncommon overall (`3.9%`), but when it appears it is usually a stronger sign of real retrieval ambiguity than simple bypass.
- The full-pool run therefore reinforces a key methodological point: retrieval quality and downstream answer quality are related but distinct measures. A benchmark that only counts correct retrieval will miss cases where bypass still yields a usable answer, and it will also miss cases where the right skill was selected but the final answer was still poor.
