# Document Rewriter

Rewrites a document while keeping its substance intact.

## Use when

- The user wants a document rewritten rather than merely summarised.
- The task is to improve wording, flow, tone, or readability.
- The output should preserve the original meaning, commitments, and substantive content.

## Workflow

1. Identify the document's purpose and intended audience if visible from the text.
2. Separate core content from awkward phrasing, repetition, or weak structure.
3. Rewrite the text so it is clearer and more coherent without changing the underlying substance.
4. Preserve important qualifiers, obligations, conditions, or factual details.
5. Return a cleaner rewritten version.

## Writing rules

- Preserve substance unless the user explicitly asks for stronger editing.
- Do not quietly remove important details, caveats, or commitments.
- Improve flow and readability without drifting into summary.
- Return only the rewritten document unless the user asks for commentary.

## Default shape

Use this shape unless the user asks for something else:

- Revised version of the document
- Keep the same core intent
- Keep important specifics intact

For worked examples, see `examples.md`.
