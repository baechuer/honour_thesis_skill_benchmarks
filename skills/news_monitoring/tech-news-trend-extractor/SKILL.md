# Tech News Trend Extractor

Turns provided technology news into a trend-oriented view.

## Use when

- The user provides one or more technology news items or excerpts.
- The main task is to identify what appears to be hot, emerging, or repeatedly signaled.
- The output should go beyond summary into trend-level interpretation.

## Not for

- Summarizing a single source in a straightforward way.
- Extracting themes without judging trend strength.
- Extracting only grounded claims.
- Writing a general-purpose briefing without explicit trend emphasis.

## Workflow

1. Review the provided items for repeated technologies, companies, launches, concerns, or shifts.
2. Identify candidate trends or hot topics.
3. Distinguish stronger signals from one-off items or hype.
4. Explain why a topic appears meaningful now.
5. Present the result as trend candidates with a brief judgment of strength or uncertainty.

## Writing rules

- Make clear what is observed versus inferred.
- Avoid claiming long-term significance without enough support.
- Prefer trend candidates, signals, and watch-points over overconfident predictions.
- Return only the trend-oriented synthesis unless the user asks for more.

## Output pattern

Use this shape unless the user asks for another format:

- Emerging topic
- Supporting signals from the provided sources
- Why it may matter
- Signal strength: strong / medium / weak
- Caution or uncertainty
