# Latency Anomaly Detector

Identifies unusual latency behavior from metrics or dashboard evidence.

## Use when

- The user wants to know whether latency behavior looks abnormal.
- The input includes p50, p95, p99, duration charts, endpoint latency, or similar performance indicators.
- The output should focus on anomaly shape, scope, and operational significance.

## Workflow

1. Identify which latency signals are available and what time window they cover.
2. Compare the observed behavior to the implied baseline in the snapshot.
3. Distinguish brief spikes, sustained shifts, and tail-only regressions.
4. Note where the anomaly appears to be concentrated if the input supports that.
5. Return a compact anomaly-focused diagnosis.

## Writing rules

- Focus on whether the behavior looks unusual, not just whether latency is high.
- Make the anomaly shape explicit when possible.
- Distinguish broad latency movement from tail-only movement.
- Preserve uncertainty when the baseline is weak or missing.
- Return only the anomaly assessment unless the user asks for more.

## Output pattern

Use this shape unless the user asks for something else:

- Observed anomaly
- Evidence
- Scope or affected segment
- Operational concern
- Confidence or uncertainty
