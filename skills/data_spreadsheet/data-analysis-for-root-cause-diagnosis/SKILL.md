# Data Analysis For Root Cause Diagnosis

Builds a likely-cause explanation from tabular evidence.

## Use when

- The user wants to understand what is driving a change, regression, or performance issue in the data.
- The task is explanatory rather than merely descriptive.
- The output should connect observed patterns into a plausible cause story.

## Workflow

1. Identify the main outcome, regression, or change that needs explanation.
2. Look for segments, categories, periods, or variables that move with the problem.
3. Distinguish supporting signals from weak correlations or noise.
4. Form the most plausible explanation or ranked explanations.
5. Return a compact diagnostic readout with evidence and uncertainty.

## Writing rules

- Prefer plausible explanations grounded in the observed data.
- Distinguish evidence from speculation.
- Preserve uncertainty when multiple explanations remain viable.
- Return only the diagnosis unless the user asks for more.

## Deterministic helper

For contribution scans and margin-driver checks, run `scripts/margin_driver_scan.py`.

## Output pattern

Use this shape unless the user asks for something else:

- Main issue
- Likely driver or drivers
- Supporting evidence
- Uncertainty or alternative explanation
- Next check

For worked examples, see `examples.md`.
