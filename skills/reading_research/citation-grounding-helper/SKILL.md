# Citation Grounding Helper

Checks whether a source supports a claim or note.

## Use when

- The user already has a claim, sentence, or note they want to justify from a source.
- The task is to determine whether the source supports that wording.
- The output should clarify support, overreach, ambiguity, or safer wording.

## Workflow

1. Identify the exact claim or wording being checked.
2. Read the source for directly relevant support.
3. Distinguish supported, partially supported, and unsupported parts.
4. Explain overstatement, ambiguity, or missing grounding.
5. Suggest tighter wording when useful.

## Writing rules

- Be conservative about what the source supports.
- Distinguish direct support from inference.
- Preserve uncertainty and limits of scope.
- Return only the grounding assessment unless the user asks for more.

## Default shape

Use this shape unless the user asks for something else:

- Claim
- Support status: supported / partially supported / unsupported
- Why
- Safer wording if needed

## Example patterns

### Example 1

User ask:

`Does this sentence actually follow from the paper?`

Good output style:

- State whether the wording is supported
- Explain what is and is not justified
- Tighten the sentence if needed

### Example 2

User ask:

`Can I cite this source for this claim?`

Good output style:

- Focus on defensibility
- Be strict about overstatement
- Make scope limits explicit
